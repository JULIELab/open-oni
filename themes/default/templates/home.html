    <h2>Welcome to {{ project_name }}</h2>
    <p><i>Romantik-Zeitungen</i> is the gateway to a full-text searchable corpus of digitized historical newspapers from the era of German romanticism. It has been set up by researchers from the <a href="http://modellromantik.uni-jena.de/">Graduate School "Romanticism as a Model"</a> and <a href="https://julielab.de">JULIE Lab</a> at Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena, Germany.</p>

<p>Currently you can search and access complete content for the <i>Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</i> (General Music Gazette, AMZ) which was published between 1798 and 1865 in Leipzig. It contains 26,390 pages of 53 volumes in total. AMZ is not only the most important periodical of music criticism of German romanticism, but also a very important text resource for literary studies. For example, E.T.A. Hoffmannâ€™s story <i>Ritter Gluck</i> was published on Feb 15, 1809 for the first time in <a href="lccn/BV002720696/1809-02-15/ed-1/seq-1/">AMZ</a>.</p>
